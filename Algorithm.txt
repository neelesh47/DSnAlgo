Algorithm Analysis and Big O notation

It is the process and formula for solving any problem

%timeit depends on speed of computer and hardware therefore Big O (generic Notation) com into picture

Big O notation --> Asymptotic analysis describes how quickly runtime will grow relative to the input get arbitary large.

Big O   Name 
1       Constant
log(n)  logarithm
n       Linear
nlog(n) log Linear
n^2     Qaudratic 
n^3     Cubic
2^n     Exponntial
